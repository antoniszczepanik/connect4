Hi! This is connect-four, a 2-player turn-based game in which each players 
goal is to connect 4 disks by dropping them into 7x6 grid.
The game has been solved (starting player always wins), however game tree is
quite large which makes it interesting algorithmic playground.

You can

You can try to
- What can you do here?
  - You can try to make automatic move
  - X valuations have been made in Y seconds
  - You can also undo move and explore

- How is this implemented
  - MiniMax algorithm
    - without popular alpha-beta prunning - evaluation of all moves
      turns out to be more important
  - Bitboards (link Dominikus)
  - Technology used C++ -> WASM

Enjoy :)
