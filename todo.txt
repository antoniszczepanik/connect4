# Connect4

The goal of this project is to have a real time connect4 game with possibly best AI opponent.
All the components should run offline inside the browser.
The project will be implemented solely in C++ and then transpiled to JS, just for the sake of it.

## Code structure
To know how to abstract the C++ code I have to know how running such transpiled code works.
For example I'm not sure which interfaces are available.
- try using Emscripten and asm.js

For now we I know that there will be:

Board class
  Offering the game engine. 
  Checking for a win.
